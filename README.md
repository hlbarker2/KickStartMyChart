# KickStart My Chart

Organize and analyze a database of four thousand past Kickstarter projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

1.	Three conclusions about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data are:
a.	The greatest number of Kickstarter campaigns and the most successful number of Kickstarter campaigns fall into the parent category of theater and the sub-parent category of plays.
b.	The greatest number of Kickstarter campaigns take place in the United States (compared to other countries).
c.	The greatest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns are created in May.
2.	The limitations of the data set are:
a.	The data set only encompasses 4,000 past projects, while over 300,000 Kickstarter projects have been launched. This poses the question of whether the data set is a representative sample of the whole.
b.	The data set does not take into consideration what strategies were used to launch and fund the campaign. Will a particular advertising or marketing strategy correlate with a successful campaign?
c.	The sub-categories could be divided into further sub-categories. Does a particular type of play (drama, comedy) correlate with a successful campaign?
